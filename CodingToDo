Coding, to do:
	- Create database method to define initial guesses for quantities based on nesting tree (define a branch as corresponding Î¼ * knot). Do this using a groupby statement (holding exogenous variables fixed, e.g. the supply variables), and loop until there is no update in values. 
	- Create database method to make a dynamic, stationary version of a database that just repeat variables.
