Coding, to do:
	- Create database method to define initial guesses for quantities based on nesting tree (define a branch as corresponding Î¼ * knot). Do this using a groupby statement (holding exogenous variables fixed, e.g. the supply variables), and loop until there is no update in values. 
	- Create database method to make a dynamic, stationary version of a database that just repeat variables.
	- Create a "fast loading"-version of the database that only loads the gdx data as the '.database' attribute. Adjust the slicing methods to look up in .series with fallback option to look for the symbol in the 'self.database' database.
